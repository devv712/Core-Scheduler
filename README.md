# Kernel-Like Process Scheduler Simulator

A C-based simulation of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms, designed to mimic kernel-level process scheduling behavior. This project demonstrates trade-offs between throughput, response time, and fairness by implementing **Round Robin (RR)**, **Priority Scheduling**, and **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This simulator models how operating systems allocate CPU time to processes and how scheduling decisions affect performance. It includes:
- Multiple scheduling algorithms
- IPC simulation between processes
- Performance benchmarking
- Extensible design to add new policies
