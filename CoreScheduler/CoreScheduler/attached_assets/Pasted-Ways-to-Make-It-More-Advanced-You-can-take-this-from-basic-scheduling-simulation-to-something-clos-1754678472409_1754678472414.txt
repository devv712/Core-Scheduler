Ways to Make It More Advanced
You can take this from “basic scheduling simulation” to something closer to a mini OS lab by adding:

Multiple Scheduling Policies in One Run
Implement dynamic switching between scheduling algorithms during execution based on workload conditions.

Multi-Core Simulation
Simulate multiple CPUs/cores and load balancing between them (e.g., assigning processes to the least-loaded core).

Preemptive Priority Scheduling with Aging
Prevent starvation by increasing the priority of waiting processes over time.

Real-Time Scheduling Support
Add Rate Monotonic (RM) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithms to handle periodic real-time tasks.

I/O Burst Simulation
Include I/O-bound processes to demonstrate CPU idle time and show how scheduling adapts.

Visualization
Generate Gantt charts or timeline plots (using Python/matplotlib or ASCII art in terminal) to visualize process execution order.

Performance Benchmarking

CPU Utilization %

Average Waiting Time

Turnaround Time

Throughput

Context Switch Count
Store these metrics in CSV and auto-generate comparison graphs.

Threaded IPC
Instead of simulated IPC, use real POSIX threads and actual pthread_mutex + pthread_cond for synchronization.

Configuration via File Input
Allow the simulator to read process details (arrival time, burst time, priority) from a file.

How to Present It as Advanced
In your résumé or GitHub README:

Emphasize real-world OS concepts you simulated: “Designed with abstractions resembling kernel process control blocks (PCB), ready queues, and scheduler hooks.”

Mention quantitative analysis: “Benchmarked 3+ algorithms across 50+ test cases and visualized CPU scheduling efficiency using Gantt charts.”

Highlight extensibility: “Supports dynamic policy switching, multi-core load balancing, and real-time algorithms.”

Include GIFs or screenshots of visualizations.

Provide a command-line interface with options like:

bash
Copy
Edit
./scheduler --policy RR --quantum 4 --input processes.txt --output results.csv
